# Cueball

Cueball is a simple project with three goals:

1. Build a simple LISP dialect for creating quantum circuits in an easy, repeatable way. 
2. The language should compile smoothly to different quantum computing architectures, from QASM2.0 (IBM) code to QUIL (Rigetti).
3. The language should make working with common quantum computing paradigms easy, much in the way conventional languages make working with logic gates "easy." The goal is not to create a quantum analog of all the classical programming structures, but rather to figure out the right way to build the same type of abstractions on top of _quantum_ registers, in a manner that makes sense for _quantum_ algorithms.

Welcome all contributions!

#### Ideas

I'm starting without most of the actual LISP part of it, but with the idea that I'll get to it eventually! If a pro LISP-er wants to fill in a simple dialect of Scheme for the language that would be awesome!
